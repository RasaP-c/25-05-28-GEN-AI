# 🛠️ Lab 8 — “Ask-Me-About Apartments” Bot

> **Focus:** Prompt-guarding · Intent check · LLM call  
> **Folder Name:** `day8_apartment_bot`

---

### 🔗 Task

- Visit the [GitHub Marketplace — Models Section](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models)
- **Find an LLM model** that could be used for apartment-related Q&A.
- Choose one that fits the use case and note its API usage, model name, and purpose.

---

## 📋 Overview

In this lab, you'll build a bot that answers questions **only** related to apartment topics. It uses intent checks and prompt-guarding to ensure that the model responds only when relevant. When off-topic, it should refuse to answer.

---

## ✅ What to Implement

### 1. 🧾 Input Handling

- **Single Question Mode**: Read one line question from `input()` command.

---

### 2. 🎯 Intent Check

- Convert the input question to lowercase.
- If the question contains **any** of the keywords below, treat it as **ON-TOPIC**:

```python
KW = ["apartment", "flat", "room", "renovation", "furniture", "storage", "decor"]
```

### 3. 🛡️ Prompt Guard

Use the exact system prompt below for the model:

```
You are an expert on improving apartments. If the user asks anything outside that domain, answer: "Sorry, I don't have knowledge on that." Wait for a new question.
```

### 4. 🧠 LLM Call

- Make an API POST request only if the question is ON-TOPIC.
- Use the following body format:

```
{
  "model": "x",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM},
    {"role": "user", "content": question}
  ]
}
```

### 5. ❌ Refusal Path

If the question is OFF-TOPIC, do not call the API.
Instead, print exactly the following message:

```
Sorry, I don't have knowledge on that.
```
