# üéì Homework ‚Äì Day 10: Working with Vector Databases and Embeddings

## üìÖ Date: [INSERT DATE HERE]

---

## üß† Objective

The goal of this assignment is to help you practice:

- Creating and using vector databases (ChromaDB)
- Embedding text with OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-3-small`
- Performing semantic search using `query_embeddings`
- Using persistent storage and metadata in your collection

---

## ‚úÖ Task Overview

You will create your own **mini knowledge base** using ChromaDB and semantic search.

---

### üß© Part 1: Create and Embed Your Own Knowledge

1. Create a new Python file: `my_insertion.py`
2. Use the embedding function from `embed.py` to embed **5 facts of your choice**
   - They can be from your favorite topic: tech, music, history, food, etc.
   - Example: `"The sun is a star."`, `"Mozart composed over 600 works."`
3. Insert those facts into a **new Chroma collection** called `"my_knowledge_base"`
   - Use `upsert()` and assign IDs like `"fact-1"`, `"fact-2"` ...
   - Store a metadata field `{"source": "homework", "student": "your_name"}`

---

### üîç Part 2: Semantic Search

1. Create a Python file: `my_search.py`
2. Prompt the user with `input("What would you like to know? ")`
3. Embed their question using the same embedding model
4. Use `query_embeddings=[...]` to find the top 2 closest facts
5. Print:
   - The matched fact(s)
   - The distance score(s)
   - The metadata of the match

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Bonus (Optional)

Try one or more of the following:

- Add `count()` logic to display total stored facts before querying
- Export all documents to a `.txt` file (`one per line`)
- Implement a check that warns if query results are far away (distance > 1.2)

---

## üì¶ What to Submit

Upload the following files:

- `my_insertion.py`
- `my_search.py`
- A screenshot or printout of:
  - Your inserted facts
  - A successful semantic search query and result

---

## üìå Notes

- Your collection should **use OpenAI-generated embeddings**, not Chroma‚Äôs default
- Use persistent storage (`PersistentClient(path="./vector-db")`)
- Don‚Äôt mix different embedding models in the same collection
- Clean, well-commented code is appreciated

---

## üèÅ Example Output

**Query:** `What type of body is the sun?`  
**Match:** `The sun is a star.`  
**Distance:** `0.1841`  
**Metadata:** `{"source": "homework", "student": "Ada"}`

Good luck, and enjoy your first hands-on RAG pipeline step! üåü
