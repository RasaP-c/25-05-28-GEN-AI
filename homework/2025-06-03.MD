### âœ… Task 1: Date Arithmetic â€“ How Old Are You?

Create a CLI script that:

1. Asks the user to input their **birthdate** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
2. Uses the `datetime` module to calculate their **age in years**.
3. Handles leap years and validates that the date is not in the future.

#### ðŸ§  Output Example:

```
Enter your birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD): 1995-07-14
ðŸŽ‚ You are 28 years old.
```

ðŸ“¦ Use `datetime.strptime()`, `date.today()`, and subtract birth year carefully.

- `calculate_age(birth_date)`: Returns the age
- `get_week_day(date)`: returns a weekday of a date (tuesday, wednesday, thursday...)
