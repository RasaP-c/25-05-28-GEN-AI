## **Week 1: Python Foundations & Environment Setup**

### **Day 1**

- **About Me**
- **The Plan**
- [Smol AI News](https://news.smol.ai/)
- **GEN-AI Engineer**
- **Software to Install:**
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- **Model vs Platform**
- **AI vs GEN-AI**

### **Day 2**

- Git
- Github
- Git through Vscode
- Basic programming in Python.

- Ollama
- Open source LLMs
- Models have various sizes.
- Models have their own advantages. Some have vision, some have reasoning,
some are more suited for translation.
- Platform provides much more than LLMs

### **Day 3**

- Python Basics
- Python debugging

- AI limitations:
  - Context is limited. Each model has its own context length.
  - Hallucinations
  - AI confidence
  - Calculations
  - It AI struggles to the answer right in first 3 times it hallucinates really bad.
  - In smaller languages (e.g. Lithuanian it struggles)
  - Knowledge cutoff date.
  - Vague recollection of the dataset.

### **Day 4**

- Python practice
- Python try/catch, While loop

- AI platform concepts:
  - tools -> 
    1. Web search
    2. Python executor
    3. Image generator
  
  - Deep research
  - File upload
  - Memory concept

- different models:
  - 

### **Day 5**

- python dictionary, list (of object)
- VScode extensions and Github copilot
- front-end vs back-end
- API, Backend system, Technology as a service.

## **Week 2: Python Foundations and Openai Usage**

### **Day 1**

- LLM Providers.
- Api-keys and secrets.
- Python library install.
- Openai Completions.

### **Day 2**

- Requirements.txt
- functions
- Read/write to a file

- System instructions, prompt engineering.

### **Day 3**

- Functions

- RAG
- RAG challenges:
  - Search must work well.
  - Context is limited.
  - AI may hallucinate
  - Infrastructure must be set well: latence( speed) affects performance.
  - It is hard to predict user.
  - Data may have conflict, unnecessary information.
  - Chatbot must be protected against misuse.
  - Information gets outdated.
  - How to TEST that chatbot works well.
  - Very often data is in words, pdf's and even images.
  Extracting data from these documents is tough.

### **Day 4**

  - Python class
  - Python practice basics.

  - RAG evaluation

### **Day 5**
  - Search is not easy
  - Embeddings
  - Vector databases
  - Similiarity search

## **Week 3: 

### Day 1:
  - Langchain
  - RAG
  - Lots of debugging.

  - genai Ethic and Censorship.

### Day 2:

  - RAG challenges in practice.

  - virtual environment, uv
